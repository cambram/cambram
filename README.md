<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cameron Brammer</h1>
<h3 align="center">An enthusiastic web developer passionate about the power of technology to change the world.</h3>
<p>I am a diligent worker with a bachelor's degree in Multimedia at the University of Pretoria to pursue a career in web and software development. Currently, I am studying my final Honours year in multimedia. Throughout my studies, I have developed a passion for software development on both the front-end and back-end of an application. Through this, I have also found a unique passion for design and all the principles that go into creating a pleasant user experience. 

I always strive to bring as much value to the work that I do to deliver the most successful piece of work I can produce. I have a unique skill of being equally creative as I am analytical which provides a great advantage for me in my work where I can look at both sides of a project. I have an excellent knowledge and feel for user experience and how to integrate that into an application through programming. I believe having a good user experience provides the best results for a website or applicationâ€™s success. Along with this, I have gained a broad knowledge of computer science as stated in my education and skills.
